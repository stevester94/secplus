A network administrator is installing a device that uses Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technologies for redundancy and provides employees remote access so that files can be accessed anywhere. The device does not require licensing and stores data at the file level. Which device is the employee likely installing in the infrastructure?
NAS

A startup company adds a firewall, an IDS, and a HIPS to its infrastructure. At the end of the week, they will install HVAC in the server room. The company has scheduled penetration testing every month. Which type of layered security does this represent?
Control diversity

A system engineer is researching backup solutions that are inexpensive and can store large amounts of data offline. The backup solution must be portable and maintainable for a certain length of time defined in the company’s backup recovery plan. Which of the following is the best backup solution?
Tape

A data center needs to ensure that data is not lost at the system level in the event of a blackout. Servers must stay operable for at least an eight-hour window as part of the response and recovery controls implemented. Which redundancy effort should be put in place to ensure the data remains available?
UPS

A system engineer enhances the security of a network by adding firewalls to both the external network and the internal company network. The firewalls are products of two separate companies. This is an example of what type of security control practice?
Vendor diversity

A company wants to automatically adjust its IT resources to meet changing demand and minimize costs as it expands its operations.  Which feature is most important for the company to achieve this goal rapidly?
Elasticity

A system engineer has tested a new application in the lab, and wants to deploy the application on a production server. The server is a virtual machine that processes and stores live data for company employees. Which of the following is the BEST approach for deploying the new application on the server?
Take a snapshot of the server before installing on the server.

A company requires a means of managing storage centrally and the ability to share the storage with multiple hosts where users can access data quickly, with little to no latency. They need to use Fibre Channel to connect the storage media. Which of the following storage architectures would best meet the company’s needs?
SAN

A system engineer can monitor and control voltage factors in a data center. The engineer can make critical decisions on the center’s energy consumption and load balancing. Which device is the engineer likely using to make these decisions?
Managed PDUs

An application requires continuity of operations to be maintained. If there is an outage, it needs to be restored within a 24 hour period due to the command and control capabilities it maintains. The failover site must be physically separated from the program office and be available within the required timeframe with live data. Which of the following solutions best describes the physical implementation?
Geographical dispersal

An aviation tracking system maintains flight records for equipment and personnel. The system is a command and control system that must maintain global availability. The entire system is on a cloud platform that guarantees a failover to multiple zones within a region. In addition to the multi-zonal cloud failover, what other solution would provide the best option to restoring data and rebuilding systems if the primary cloud service becomes unavailable?
Offsite backup and storage

Which Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) combines mirroring and striping and improves performance and redundancy?
RAID-10

A company has implemented a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) where the user’s desktop operates as a Virtual Machine (VM) on a centralized server. When users log off the machine, any changes made at the VM level are not saved. Which means of non-persistence has been implemented?
Revert to known state
