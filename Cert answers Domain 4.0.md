An incident involving a data breach is under investigation at a major video game software company. The incident involves the unauthorized transfer of a sensitive file to an outside source (a leak). During the investigation, something occurs where neither the DLP team or employees can find the concerning file that was once found on the network. Verify the data loss prevention (DLP) terminology that describes what has occurred to the file in question.
